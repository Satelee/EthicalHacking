## 172. Type Conversion Exercise ##

# program to display user's age based on year
birth_year = input('what year were you born? ')     # allows user to input year of birth

age = 2021 - int(birth_year)    # calculates age

print('Your age is: ', age)     # prints age to user


# for printing, another possible way is to use the 'f' function. e.g.
# print(f'Your age is: {age}')
